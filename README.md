## 🎯 Game Systems

### Resource System
- **Gold**: Generated by Gold Mines at 0.5 gold/second per level
- **Elixir**: Generated by Elixir Collectors at 0.5 elixir/second per level
- Resources automatically accumulate over time based on building levels

### Building System
- **Town Hall**: Central building, unlocks new features (max level 5)
- **Gold Mine**: Generates gold automatically
- **Elixir Collector**: Generates elixir automatically
- **Army Camp**: Increases troop capacity (requires TH level 2)
- **Barracks**: Enables troop training (requires TH level 2)

Each building has:
- Upgrade costs (Gold/Elixir)
- Upgrade time (30 seconds to 5 minutes)
- Maximum level based on Town Hall level

### Troop Training System
- **Barbarian**: Basic melee unit (25 elixir, 20s training time)
- **Archer**: Ranged unit (50 elixir, 25s training time)
- **Giant**: Tank unit (250 elixir, 2 minute training time)

### Combat System
The combat system is simplified:
1. Calculate total power: (HP + Damage) × Troop Count
2. Compare player power vs enemy base power
3. Victory requires 1.2x power ratio
4. Stars awarded based on performance (1-3)

### Campaign Missions
5 progressive missions:
1. **Tutorial Village** - Easy introduction
2. **Goblin Outpost** - Medium difficulty
3. **Barbarian Camp** - Challenging
4. **Giant Stronghold** - Hard
5. **Dragon Fortress** - Very hard

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **UI Components**: Custom shadcn/ui-inspired components

## 📊 Game Balancing

All game formulas and costs are defined in `src/lib/gameConstants.ts`:
- Building costs increase exponentially
- Resource generation scales with building level
- Troop stats balanced for strategic gameplay
- Mission difficulty progresses smoothly

## 💾 Data Persistence

The game uses Zustand's persist middleware with localStorage:
- Automatic saving on every state change
- Data survives browser refresh
- No backend required - fully client-side

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

- **Fantasy Theme**: Purple and pink gradients, soft shadows
- **Clean UI**: Card-based layout with clear information hierarchy
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with breakpoints
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions using Framer Motion
- **Accessible**: Clear typography and color contrast

## 🔮 Future Expansion Ideas

- **Defense System**: Add defensive buildings (Cannons, Archer Towers, Walls)
- **More Troops**: Add spell units, healers, dragons
- **Multiplayer**: Add PvP battles and leaderboards
- **Clan System**: Create and join clans
- **Advanced Combat**: Real-time troop deployment with AI pathfinding
- **3D Graphics**: Integrate Three.js or React Three Fiber for 3D village view
- **Sound Effects**: Add audio feedback for actions
- **Achievements**: Track player milestones and award bonuses

## 📝 Development Notes

### Adding New Buildings
1. Add building type to `BuildingType` in `gameStore.ts`
2. Define costs in `BUILDING_COSTS` in `gameConstants.ts`
3. Set upgrade times in `BUILDING_UPGRADE_TIME`
4. Add display name to `BUILDING_NAMES`
5. Update max buildings array based on Town Hall requirements

### Adding New Troops
1. Add troop type to `TroopType` in `gameStore.ts`
2. Define costs and training time in `TROOP_COSTS`
3. Add stats to `TROOP_STATS`
4. Update combat simulation if needed

### Modifying Game Balance
Edit values in `src/lib/gameConstants.ts`:
- Adjust resource generation rates
- Change upgrade costs and times
- Modify troop stats
- Tune combat power calculations

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Single-player only (no multiplayer)
- Simplified combat (no real-time battles)
- Limited building placement (no drag-and-drop)
- No visual representations of battles
- Browser storage only (no cloud sync)
